Upgrade the Codefresh on-premises platform to the latest version:
* Prepare for the upgrade: _Before_ the upgrade, based on the version you are upgrading to, complete the required tasks
* Upgrade the platform
* Complete post-upgrade configuration: If needed, also based on the version you are upgrading to, complete the required tasks


###  Upgrade to 1.1.1
Prepare for the upgrade to v1.1.1 by performing the tasks listed below.

#### Maintain backward compatibility for infrastructure services
If you have Codefresh version 1.0.202 or lower installed, and are upgrading to v1.1.1, to retain the existing images for the services listed below, update the `config.yaml` for `kcfi`.

* `cf-mongodb`
* `cf-redis`
* `cf-rabbitmq`
* `cf-postgresql`
* `cf-nats`
* `cf-consul`

> In the `config.yaml`, as in the example below, if needed, replace the `bitnami` prefix with that of your private repo.

```yaml
