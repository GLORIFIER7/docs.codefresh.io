### Hosted and hybrid runtimes
Codefresh Hosted GitOps is based on a runtime, hosted and managed by Codefresh.  

After the three-step process of provisioning your hosted runtime, Codefresh handles administration and maintenance of the hosted runtime, including version and security updates.    

In addition to the hosted runtime, you can have as many hybrid runtimes as you need to in your account.

### Dashboards for visibility and traceability

A set of dashboards provides visibility into all aspects of deployment:  

* The Home dashboard presents enterprise-wide deployment highlights across runtimes and clusters, making it a useful management tool.  
  Get insights into important KPIs and deployments,  all in the same location. View status of runtimes and managed clusters, deployments, failed deployments with rollbacks, most active applications.  Use filters to narrow the scope to focus on anything specific.  

* The Applications dashboard displays applications across runtimes and clusters, from which you can select and analyze individual applications.  
  Individual application information is grouped by current and historical deployments, enriched with Argo, Jira, and Git details, including rollout visualizations for ongoing deployments, and an interactive tree view of application resources.


* DORA metrics has become integral to enterprises wanting to quantify DevOps performance, and Codefresh has out-of-the-box support for it.
Apart from the metrics themselves, the DORA dashboard in Codefresh has several unique features to pinpoint just which applications or runtimes are contributing to problematic metrics.  


### Application management

Manage the application lifecycle in the Codefresh UI, from creating, editing, and deleting applications, to quick manual sync when needed.  


### Third-party integrations
Add integrations to issue-tracking tools such as Jira and container-registries such as Docker Hub, JFrog and more, to report and enrich images.
